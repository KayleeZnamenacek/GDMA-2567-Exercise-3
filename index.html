                <h1>The All-Inclusive Guide to Web Typography Best Practices</h1>
            </header>
            <p> August 27, 2014  Marc Schenker  Web Design</p>
            <p> Look around the Internet, and note how typography absolutely dominates web design in every aspect. After all, there’s a reason that <a href="http://ia.net/blog/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period/"> web design is 95% typography</a>. This makes a world of sense when you think about it. The Internet is all about content, and content means text and words. And that means typography.</p>
            <p> The smart web designer knows this and will therefore devote a lot of careful thought and deliberation to getting typography right on any site that he’s working on. In his quest to make type both functional and attractive to the reader, he has to consider a bunch of different factors when planning the information architecture of the site. What sort of fonts are the most readable? Which fonts are easy for readers to skim through? What about fonts that are legible?</p>
            <p>Because of all of these questions and considerations, it’s not that easy to nail typography for a website on the first try. However, we scoured the web and found <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/17/typographic-design-patterns-practices-case-study-2013/"> this seminal bit of research from Smashing Magazine into the current, best practices of typography</a>, which are eye-opening, to say the least. We’ve dug deep into this data to present you with an authoritative guide to typography best practices on the Internet. Enjoy.</p>

                <h2> Headings</h2>
            </header>
            <p> The headings in your site copy are arguably very important because depressing research shows that the majority of people only <a href="http://killallcomedy.com/recent-study-people-only-read-headlines-not-whole-story/">read headlines on the Internet</a>. When user behavior is such that many of your readers won’t even bother with the body copy, then you have to make the typeface of the headings really stand out to grab their attention and persuade them to read further.</p>
            <p> According to the aforementioned Smashing Magazine study from 2013, it’s almost a tie between sans-serif and serif fonts for headings, with 51% of headings using sans-serif and just over 47% using serif. Serif fonts have become increasingly popular in the last few years, mainly due to the belief that they stand out in headlines and offer site visitors a readable structure.</p>
            <p> On the issue of popularity, the two most popular serif fonts for headlines are <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/georgia/">Georgia</a> and <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/chaparral-pro">Chaparral Pro</a> while the two most popular sans-serif fonts for headlines are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial">Arial</a> and <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/freight-sans-pro">Freight Sans Pro</a>.</p>
            <p> While you can certainly experiment with your own typefaces for the headings on your website, know that the popularity of these fonts is because of positive feedback from readers.</p>

                <h2> Body</h2>
            </header>
            <p> The body of your website makes up the most important part of your content—even if fewer people read that than the actual headings and headlines on webpages. Unlike the near tie between sans and sans-serif fonts in headings, the clear winner when it comes to body copy is serif. According to the same study, a whopping 61.5% of websites utilize serif fonts in their body copy, but just a paltry 36.5% use sans-serif fonts for their body copy.</p>
            <p>Let’s look at how this breaks down even further. The most frequently used serif fonts for body copy are Georgia and Chaparral Pro, almost mirroring the proportions for headings. On the sans-serif front, the most frequently used sans-serif fonts for body copy are Arial and <a href="http://www.fonts.com/font/linotype/helvetica">Helvetica</a>. </p>

                <h2> An Interesting Note</h2>
            </header>
            <p> It’s noteworthy that the study also determined that the majority of websites currently don’t use any standard fonts as their main typeface. Some 39% of the body copy and 66% of the headlines in the websites looked at in the study didn’t use standard fonts. One theory for this somewhat surprising finding is that services like Fontdeck and Typekit make it easier than ever for brands to set themselves apart in a unique way from their competitors.</p>
            <p> Here’s the takeaway from all of this: Yes, you can play it safe and choose a “non-threatening,” standard font, but many websites have boldly opted against this. They’re finding that their site visitors and readers are very receptive to unconventional typefaces, so long as they don’t hurt the user experience on websites.</p>

                <h2> Backgrounds</h2>
            </header>
            <p> It goes without saying that a respectable background in web design is whatever color lets the text on it stand out in contrast. This naturally makes it super-easy for site visitors to read the copy much more efficiently, thereby contributing to readability. The Smashing Magazine study found that most websites preferred a dark-on-light arrangement. This means darker text on a lighter-colored background. However, what’s really important to point out for the state of typography currently is that the dark-on-light arrangement is getting less harsh. For instance, <a href="http://aneventapart.com/">some websites are experimenting with a dark-gray-text-on-beige-background arrangement</a>. In such a scheme, the contrast is less pronounced, yet still provides readers with a comfortable reading experience that facilitates easy scanning of every line.</p>
            <p> Unsurprisingly, when it comes to body copy, the old favorite of black text on a white background is still the gold standard.</p>
            <p> Besides being very easy to read because of the sharp contrast, the black-on-white effect also harkens back to the classic color format in newspapers, which also explains its widespread popularity in Internet body copy.</p>
